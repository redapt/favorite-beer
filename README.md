# favorite-beer
A series of demo apps in various stacks.  Can be used in various presos.  All apps have the theme 'favorite-beer' because I can't think of anything else right now ;-).  

- The point is to show tech. 
- Can be integrated with Project Gambrinus at some point?
- Chatbot's of various flavors can be integrated as well.
